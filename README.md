# Hack Assembler

This is an assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly language
into Hack binary code!

Developing this has taught me a basic set of skills such as: handling command-line arguments,
handling input and output text files, parsing instructions, handling white space, handling symbols,
generating code, and many other techniques that I think is useful for daily coding life.
