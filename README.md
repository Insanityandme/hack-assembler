# Hack Assembler

## This is an assembler that translates programs written in the Hack assembly language into Hack binary code.

### Developing this has taught me a basic set of skills such as: 
* handling command-line arguments
* handling input and output text files
* parsing instructions
* handling white space and symbols
* generating binary code

And many other techniques that I think is useful for daily coding life.
